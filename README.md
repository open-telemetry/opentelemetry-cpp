## Release Schedule

OpenTelemetry C++ is under active development.

The library is not yet _generally available_, and releases aren't guaranteed to
conform to a specific version of the specification. Future releases will not
attempt to maintain backwards compatibility with previous releases. Each alpha
and beta release includes significant changes to the API and SDK packages,
making them incompatible with each other.

See the [release
notes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/releases)
for existing releases.

See the [project
milestones](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/milestones)
for details on upcoming releases. The dates and features described in issues
and milestones are estimates, and subject to change.
