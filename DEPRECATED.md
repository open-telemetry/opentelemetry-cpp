### Drop C++11 support

#### Announcement (C++11)

* Date: 2022-12-01
* Issue: [DEPRECATION] Drop C++11 support
  [#1830](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/1830)
* This announcement has been pinned,
  visible in the issues pages since December 2022.

#### Motivation (C++11)

This repository, opentelemetry-cpp, supports a "bring your own dependency" model.

In this model,
the build scripts can be configured to:

* pick a given version for a third party library,
* build opentelemetry-cpp with the library given.

The makefiles do not mandate to use a particular version,
hence the "bring your own" denomination.

To have an up to date build, projects are encouraged to use up to date
versions of third party libraries, to benefit from bug fixes.

Now, many libraries deliver new versions that require C++14, bug fixes
releases for C++11 are no longer available.

In particular, the following components:

* GRPC C++
* abseil
* googletest

now require C++14, per
[google support policies](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

As a result, to stay up to date, opentelemetry-cpp needs to upgrade its
minimum build requirements to use C++14 instead of C++11.

#### Scope (C++11)

Continuous Integration (CI) builds will use C++14 instead of C++11.

The CI build for gcc 4.8 is now deprecated, to be decommissioned when C++11
support is dropped.

#### Mitigation (C++11)

Building the code with recent third party libraries will require C++14
instead of C++11.

#### Planned end of life (C++11)

Support for C++11 in opentelemetry-cpp will end on September 2023.

After this date, opentelemetry-cpp may still build properly in C++11 mode,
assuming a suitable, old, version for each dependency is used,
but the C++11 build will no longer be tested for each new release.

### Jaeger propagator

#### Announcement (Jaeger)

* Version: 1.8.2
* Date: 2023-01-31
* PR: [DEPRECATION] Deprecate the Jaeger exporter
  [#1923](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/1923)

This PR also listed the Jaeger propagator as deprecated.

#### Motivation (Jaeger)

The Jaeger Exporter is now (July 2023) removed from the OpenTelemetry specification.

The Jaeger Propagator remains, because changing propagation is a longer
process compared to changing an export format.

New deployments however are encouraged to use a W3C compliant propagator,
and avoid the Jaeger propagator, which is now deprecated.

#### Scope (Jaeger)

The following are deprecated and planned for removal:

* the API header `opentelemetry/trace/propagation/jaeger.h`, including:
  * the C++ class `JaegerPropagator`

#### Mitigation (Jaeger)

Use a W3C compliant propagator instead.

That is, use class HttpTraceContext and "traceparent" tags.

Do not use class JaegerPropagator and "uber-trace-id" tags.

#### Planned removal (Jaeger)

No date set yet for the Jaeger Propagator.

### ZPages exporter

#### Announcement (ZPages)

* Version: 1.11.0
* Date: 2023-09-01
* PR: [DEPRECATION] Deprecate ZPAGES
  [#2291](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/pull/2291)

#### Motivation (ZPages)

The ZPages specification itself was introduced in 2020,
and has been experimental ever since,
not getting a lot of attention, and never reaching a stable status.

Several other opentelemetry projects have implemented support for zpages,
only to later deprecate and then remove the zpages implementation (Java,
C#), abandoning the zpages feature.

In this context, it does not make sense to continue to maintain the zpages
code in opentelemetry-cpp.

#### Scope (ZPages)

The following are deprecated and planned for removal:

* all the API headers located under
  `ext/include/opentelemetry/ext/zpages/`, including:
  * the C++ class `ThreadsafeSpanData`
  * the C++ class `TracezDataAggregator`
  * the C++ class `TracezHttpServer`
  * the C++ class `TracezSpanProcessor`
  * the C++ class `TracezSharedData`
  * the C++ class `ZPages`
  * the C++ class `zPagesHttpServer`
* all the code and doc located under `ext/src/zpages/`
* all the tests located under `ext/test/zpages/`
* the zpages exporter library(`opentelemetry_zpages`)
* the zpages build options in CMake (`WITH_ZPAGES`)

The following code is no longer considered public, will no longer be
installed, and will no longer be useable outside of
the opentelemetry-cpp implementation:

* all the API headers located under
  `ext/include/opentelemetry/ext/http/server`, including:
  * the C++ class `FileHttpServer`
  * the C++ class `HttpRequestCallback`
  * the C++ class `HttpServer`
  * the C++ class `HttpRequestHandler`
  * the C++ class `SocketCallback`

This implementation of an HTTP server is meant to be used for testing only,
it is not production ready.

#### Mitigation (ZPages)

Consider using a different exporter,
for example the OTLP exporter (both OTLP HTTP and OTLP GRPC are supported),
to expose trace data to a separate trace backend.

Note that this changes the access pattern:

* with zpages, data is only available locally (in process)
* with other exporters, data is available externally (not in process)

Our assessment is that the zpages implementation is no longer in use,
and can be removed.

If that assessment is incorrect (i.e., if you own a project that depends
on the zpage exporter from opentelemetry-cpp), please comment on the
removal issue
[#2292](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/issues/2292).

An alternative to zpage removal is to move the code to the
opentelemetry-cpp-contrib github
[repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp-contrib).

Contributions to migrate the code, and maintain zpages, are welcome.

#### Planned removal (ZPages)

* Date: December, 2023
