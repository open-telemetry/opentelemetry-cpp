# Simple Trace Example

In this example, the application in `main.cc` initializes and registers a tracer
provider from the [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp).
The application then calls a `foo_library` which has been instrumented using
the [OpenTelemetry API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/tree/main/api).
Resulting telemetry is directed to stdout through the StdoutSpanExporter.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on building and running the example.
