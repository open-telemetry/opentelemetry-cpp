# Using clang-format

## Command-line use

To format a file according to Coding style using command line, please setup the build tools environment first.

For Windows - cmd.exe command:

```call tools\setup-devenv.cmd```

For Linux and Mac:

```. tools/setup-devenv.sh```

Command will add the tools from repo *tools* directory to PATH environment variable.

Then run:

```git cl format <filename>```

At the moment the tool requires you to specify the path to file you want to format.
Long-term goal is to integrate the [clang-format from Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/clang_format.md) to automatically format all source code files being changed.

## Alternative

Run: `tools/format.sh`

Or, via Docker: `./ci/run_docker.sh ./ci/do_ci.sh format`

## Editor integrations

## Are robots taking over my freedom to choose where newlines go

No. For the project as a whole, using clang-format is just one optional way to format your code.
While it will produce style-guide conformant code, other formattings would also satisfy the style
guide. For certain modules it may be appropriate to use alternate coding style. In those scenarios
a local directory *.clang-format* settings file takes precedence over the one at top-level.
