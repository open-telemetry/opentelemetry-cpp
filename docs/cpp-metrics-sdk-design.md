# Metrics SDK Design

## Design Tenets

* Reliability
    * The Metrics API and SDK should be “reliable,” meaning that metrics data will always be accounted for. It will get back to the user or an error will be logged.  Reliability also entails that the end-user application will never be blocked.  Error handling will therefore not interfere with the execution of the instrumented program.  The library may “fail fast” during the initialization or configuration path however.
    * Thread Safety
        * As with the Tracer API and SDK, thread safety is not guaranteed on all functions and will be explicitly mentioned in documentation for functions that support concurrent calling.  Generally, the goal is to lock functions which change the state of library objects (incrementing the value of a Counter or adding a new Observer for example) or access global memory.  As a performance consideration, the library strives to hold locks for as short a duration as possible to avoid lock contention concerns.  Calls to create instrumentation may not be thread-safe as this is expected to occur during initialization of the program.
* Scalability
    * As OpenTelemetry is a distributed tracing system, it must be able to operate on sizeable systems with predictable overhead growth.  A key requirement of this is that the library does not consume unbounded memory resource.
* Security
    * Currently security is not a key consideration but may be addressed at a later date.

## SDK Data Path Diagram

<!-- [//]: # ![Data Path Diagram](../images/DataPath.png) -->

This is the control path our implementation of the metrics SDK will follow. There are five main components: The controller, accumulator, aggregators, processor, and exporter. Each of these components will be further elaborated on.


# API Class Implementations

## **MeterProvider Class**

The singleton global `MeterProvider` can be used to obtain a global Meter by calling `global.GetMeter(name,version)` which calls `GetMeter() `on the initialized global `MeterProvider`.

**Global Meter Provider**

The API should support a global `MeterProvider`. When a global instance is supported, the API must ensure that `Meter` instances derived from the global `MeterProvider` are initialized after the global SDK implementation is first initialized.

A `MeterProvider` interface must support a  `global.SetMeterProvider(MeterProvider)` function which installs the SDK implementation of the `MeterProvider` into the API.

**Obtaining a Meter from MeterProvider**

**`GetMeter(name, version)` method must be supported**


* Expects 2 string arguments:
    * name (required): identifies the instrumentation library.
    * version (optional): specifies the version of the instrumenting library (the library injecting OpenTelemetry calls into the code).

### Implementation

The Provider class offers static functions to both get and set the global MeterProvider. Once a user sets the MeterProvider, it will replace the default No-op implementation stored as a private variable and persist for the remainder of the program’s execution. This pattern imitates the TracerProvider used in the Tracing portion of this SDK.


```cc
# meter_provider.cc
class MeterProvider
{
public:
  /*
   * Get Meter
   *
   * Gets or creates a named meter instance.
   *
   * Arguments:
   * library_name, the name of the instrumenting library.
   * library_version, the version of the instrumenting library (OPTIONAL).
   */
  nostd::shared_ptr<Meter> GetMeter(nostd::string_view library_name,
                                     nostd::string_view library_version = "") {

    // Create an InstrumentationInfo object which holds the library name and version.
    // Call the Meter constructor with InstrumentationInfo.
    InstrumentationInfo instrumentationInfo;
    instrumentationInfo.SetName(library_name);
    if library_version:
      instrumentationInfo.SetVersion(library_version);
    return nostd::shared_ptr<Meter>(Meter(this, instrumentationInfo));
  }

};
```



## **Meter Class**


**Metric Events**

Metric instruments are primarily defined by their name.  Names MUST conform to the following syntax:


* Non-empty string
* case-insensitive
* first character non-numeric, non-space, non-punctuation
* subsequent characters alphanumeric, ‘_’, ‘.’ , and ‘-’

`Meter` instances MUST return an error when multiple instruments with the same name are registered

**The meter implementation will throw an illegal argument exception if the user-passed `name` for a metric instrument either conflicts with the name of another metric instrument created from the same `meter` or violates the `name` syntax outlined above.**

Each distinctly named Meter (i.e. Meters derived from different instrumentation libraries) MUST create a new namespace for metric instruments descending from them.  Thus, the same instrument name can be used in an application provided they come from different Meter instances.

**In order to achieve this, each instance of the `Meter` class will have a container storing all metric instruments that were created using that meter. This way, metric instruments created from different instantiations of the `Meter` class will never be compared to one another and will never result in an error.**


### Implementation

```cc
# meter.h / meter.cc
class Meter : public API::Meter {
public:
 /*
  * Constructor for Meter class
  *
  * Arguments:
  * MeterProvider, the MeterProvider object that spawned this Meter.
  * InstrumentationInfo, the name of the instrumentation library and, optionally,
  *                      the version.
  *
  */
  explicit Meter(MeterProvider meterProvider,
                 InstrumentationInfo instrumentationInfo) {
    meterProvider_(meterProvider);
    instrumentationInfo_(instrumentationInfo);
  }

Metric instruments created from this Meter class will be stored in a map (or another, similar container [needs to be nostd]) called “metrics.” This is identical to the Python implementation and makes sense because the SDK implementation of the `Meter` class should have a function titled `collect_all()` that collects metrics for every instrument created from this meter. In contrast, Java’s implementation has a `MeterSharedState` class that contains a registry (hash map) of all metric instruments spawned from this meter. However, since each `Meter` has its own unique instruments it is easier to store the instruments in the meter itself.

The SDK implementation of the `Meter` class will contain a function called `collect_all()` that will collect the measurements from each metric stored in the `metrics` container. The implementation of this class acts as the accumulator in the SDK specification.

**Pros of this implementation:**


* Different constructors and overloaded template calls to those constructors for the various metric instruments allows us to forego much of the code duplication involved in supporting various types.
* Storing the metric instruments created from this meter directly in the meter object itself allows us to implement the collect_all method without creating a new class that contains the meter state and instrument registry.

**Cons of this implementation:**


* Different constructors for the different metric instruments means less duplicated code but still a lot.
* Storing the metric instruments in the Meter class means that if we have multiple meters, metric instruments are stored in various objects. Using an instrument registry that maps meters to metric instruments resolves this. However, we have designed our SDK to only support one Meter instance.
* Storing 8 maps in the meter class is costly. However, we believe that this is ok because these maps will only need to be created once, at the instantiation of the meter class. **We believe that these maps will not slow down the pipeline in any meaningful way**

**The SDK implementation of the `Meter` class will act as the Accumulator mentioned in the SDK specification.**


## **Metric Instrument Class**

Metric instruments capture raw measurements of designated quantities in instrumented applications. All measurements captured by the Metrics API are associated with the instrument which collected that measurement.


### Metric Instrument Data Model

Each instrument must have enough information to meaningfully attach its measured values with a process in the instrumented application. As such, metric instruments contain the following fields


* name (string) — Identifier for this metric instrument.
* description (string) — Short description of what this instrument is capturing.
* value_type (string or enum) — Determines whether the value tracked is an int64 or double.
* meter (Meter) — The Meter instance from which this instrument was derived.
* label_keys (KeyValueIterable) — A nostd class acting as map from nostd::string_view to nostd::string_view.
* enabled (boolean) — Determines whether the instrument is currently collecting data.
* bound_instruments (key value container) — Contains the bound instruments derived from this instrument.

### Metric Event Data Model

Each measurement taken by a Metric instrument is a Metric event which must contain the following information:


* timestamp (implicit) — System time when measurement was captured.
* instrument definition(strings) — Name of instrument, kind, description, and unit of measure
* label set (key value pairs) — Labels associated with the capture, described further below.
* resources associated with the SDK at startup

**Label Set**

A key:value mapping of some kind MUST be supported as annotation each metric event. Labels must be represented the same way throughout the API (i.e. using the same idiomatic data structure) and duplicates are dealt with by taking the last value mapping.

Due to the requirement to maintain ABI stability we have chosen to implement labels as type KeyValueIterable. Though, due to performance reasons, we may convert to std::string internally.


### Implementation

A base Metric class defines the constructor and binding functions which each metric instrument will need. Once an instrument is bound, it becomes a BoundInstrument which extends the BaseBoundInstrument class. The BaseBoundInstrument is what communicates with the aggregator and performs the actual updating of values. An enum helps to organize the numerous types of metric instruments that will be supported.

The only addition to the SDK metric instrument classes from their API counterparts is the function GetRecords() and the private variables std::map<std::string, BoundSynchronousInstrument> to hold bound instruments and Aggregator<T> to hold the instrument's aggregator.

**For more information about the structure of metric instruments, refer to the Metrics API Design document.**


# Metrics SDK Data Path Implementation

Note: these requirements come from a specification currently under development. Changes and feedback are in [PR #347](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/347) and the current document is linked [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/64bbb0c611d849b90916005d7714fa2a7132d0bf/specification/metrics/sdk.md).

<!-- [//]: # ![Data Path Diagram](../images/DataPath.png) -->

## **Accumulator**

The Accumulator is responsible for computing aggregation over a fixed unit of time. It essentially takes a set of captures and turns them into a quantity that can be collected and used for meaningful analysis by maintaining aggregators for each active instrument and each distinct label set. For example, the aggregator for a counter must combine multiple calls to Add(increment) into a single sum.

Accumulators MUST support a `Checkpoint()` operation which saves a snapshot of the current state for collection and a `Merge()` operation which combines the state from multiple aggregators into one.

Calls to the Accumulator's  `Collect()` sweep through metric instruments with un-exported updates, checkpoints their aggregators, and submits them to the processor/exporter. This and all other accumulator operations should be extremely efficient and follow the shortest code path possible.

Design choice: We have chosen to implement the Accumulator as the SDK implementation of the Meter interface shown above.


## **Aggregator**

The term *aggregator* refers to an implementation that can combine multiple metric updates into a single, combined state for a specific function. Aggregators MUST support `Update()`, `Checkpoint()`, and `Merge()` operations. `Update()` is called directly from the Metric instrument in response to a metric event, and may be called concurrently.  The `Checkpoint()` operation is called to atomically save a snapshot of the Aggregator. The `Merge()` operation supports dimensionality reduction by combining state from multiple aggregators into a single Aggregator state.

The SDK must include the Counter aggregator which maintains a sum and the gauge aggregator which maintains last value and timestamp. In addition, the SDK should include MinMaxSumCount, Sketch, Histogram, and Exact aggregators
All operations should be atomic in languages that support them.


```cc
# aggregator.cc
class Aggregator {
public:
    explicit Aggregator() {
        self.current_ = nullptr
        self.checkpoint_ = nullptr
    }

   /*
    * Update
    *
    * Updates the current value with the new value.
    *
    * Arguments:
    * value, the new value to update the instrument with.
    *
    */
    virtual void Update(<T> value);

   /*
    * Checkpoint
    *
    * Stores a snapshot of the current value.
    *
    */
    virtual void Checkpoint();

   /*
    * Merge
    *
    * Combines two aggregator values. Update to most recent time stamp.
    *
    * Arguments:
    * other, the aggregator whose value to merge.
    *
    */
    virtual void Merge(Aggregator other);

    /*
     * Getters for various aggregator specific fields
     */
     virtual std::vector<T> get_value() {return current_;}
     virtual std::vector<T> get_checkpoint() {return checkpoint_;}
     virtual core::SystemTimeStamp get_timestamp() {return last_update_timestamp_;}

private:
    std::vector<T> current_;
    std::vector<T> checkpoint_;
    core::Systemtimestamp last_update_timestamp_;
};
```



```
# counter_aggregator.cc
template <class T>
class CounterAggregator : public Aggregator<T> {
public:
    explicit CounterAggregator(): current(0), checkpoint(0),
                                  last_update_timestamp(nullptr){}

    void Update(T value) {
      // thread lock
      // current += value
      this->last_update_timestamp = time_ns()
    }

    void Checkpoint() {
      // thread lock
      this->checkpoint = this->current
      this->current = 0
    }

    void Merge(CounterAggregator* other) {
      // thread lock
      // combine checkpoints
      // update timestamp to now
    }
};
```


This Counter is an example Aggregator. We plan on implementing all the Aggregators in the specification: Counter, Gauge, MinMaxSumCount, Sketch, Histogram, and Exact.


## **Processor**

The Processor SHOULD act as the primary source of configuration for exporting metrics from the SDK. The two kinds of configuration are:


1. Given a metric instrument, choose which concrete aggregator type to apply for in-process aggregation.
2. Given a metric instrument, choose which dimensions to export by (i.e., the "grouping" function).

During the collection pass, the Processor receives a full set of check-pointed aggregators corresponding to each (Instrument, LabelSet) pair with an active record managed by the Accumulator. According to its own configuration, the Processor at this point determines which dimensions to aggregate for export; it computes a checkpoint of (possibly) reduced-dimension export records ready for export. It can be thought of as the business logic or processing phase in the pipeline.


Change of dimensions: The user-facing metric API allows users to supply LabelSets containing an unlimited number of labels for any metric update. Some metric exporters will restrict the set of labels when exporting metric data, either to reduce cost or because of system-imposed requirements. A *change of dimensions* maps input LabelSets with potentially many labels into a LabelSet with a fixed set of label keys. A change of dimensions eliminates labels with keys not in the output LabelSet and fills in empty values for label keys that are not in the input LabelSet. This can be used for different filtering options, rate limiting, and alternate aggregation schemes. Additionally, it will be used to prevent unbounded memory growth through capping collected data. The community is still deciding exactly how metrics data will be pruned and this document will be updated when a decision is made.


The following is a pseudo code implementation of a ‘simple’ Processor.

Note: Josh MacDonald is working on implementing a [‘basic’ Processor](https://github.com/jmacd/opentelemetry-go/blob/jmacd/mexport/sdk/metric/processor/simple/simple.go) which allows for further Configuration that lines up with the specification in Go. He will be finishing the implementation and updating the specification within the next few weeks.

Design choice: We recommend that we implement the ‘simple’ Processor first as apart of the MVP and then will also implement the ‘basic’ Processor later on. Josh recommended having both for doing different processes.


```cc
#processor.cc
class Processor {
public:

  explicit Processor(Bool stateful) {
    // stateful determines whether the processor computes deltas or lifetime changes
    // in metric values
    stateful_ = stateful;
  }

 /*
  * Process
  *
  * This function chooses which dimensions to aggregate for export.  In the
  * reference implementation, the UngroupedProcessor does not process records
  * and simple passes them along to the next step.
  *
  * Arguments:
  * record, a record containing data collected from the active Accumulator
  * in this data pipeline
  */
  void Process(Record record);

 /*
  * Checkpoint
  *
  * This function computes a new (possibly dimension-reduced) checkpoint set of
  * all instruments in the meter passed to process.
  *
  */
  Collection<Record> Checkpoint();

 /*
  * Finished Collection
  *
  * Signals to the intergrator that a collection has been completed and
  * can now be sent for export.
  *
  */
  Error FinishedCollection();

 /*
  * Aggregator For
  *
  * Returns the correct aggregator type for a given metric instrument.  Used in
  * the instrument constructor to select which aggregator to use.
  *
  * Arguments:
  * kind, the instrument type asking to be assigned an aggregator
  *
  */
  Aggregator AggregatorFor(MetricKind kind);

private:
  Bool stateful_;
  Batch batch_;
};
```



## **Controller**

Controllers generally are responsible for binding the Accumulator, the Processor, and the Exporter. The controller initiates the collection and export pipeline and manages all the moving parts within it. It also governs the flow of data through the SDK components. Users interface with the controller to begin collection process.

Once the decision has been made to export, the controller must call `Collect()` on the Accumulator, then read the checkpoint from the Processor, then invoke the Exporter.

Java’s IntervalMetricReader class acts as a parallel to the controller. The user gets an instance of this class, sets the configuration options (like the tick rate) and then the controller takes care of the collection and exporting of metric data from instruments the user defines.

There are two different controllers: Push and Pull. The “Push” Controller will establish a periodic timer to regularly collect and export metrics. A “Pull” Controller will await a pull request before initiating metric collection.

We recommend implementing the PushController as the initial implementation of the Controller. This Controller is the base controller in the specification. We may also implement the PullController if we have the time to do it.


```cc
#push_controller.cc
class PushController {

    explicit PushController(Meter meter, Exporter exporter,
                            int period, int timeout) {
        meter_ = meter;
        exporter_ = exporter();
        period_ = period;
        timeout_ = timeout;
        provider_ = NewMeterProvider(accumulator);
    }

   /*
    * Provider
    *
    * Returns the MeterProvider stored by this controller.
    *
    */
    MeterProvider Provider {
        return this.provider_;
    }

   /*
    * Start (THREAD SAFE)
    *
    * Begins a ticker that periodically collects and exports metrics with a
    * configured interval.
    *
    */
    void Start();

   /*
    * Stop (THREAD SAFE)
    *
    * Waits for collection interval to end then exports metrics one last time
    * before returning.
    *
    */
    void Stop();

   /*
    * Run
    *
    * Used to wait between collection intervals.
    *
    */
    void run();

   /*
    * Tick (THREAD SAFE)
    *
    * Called at regular intervals, this function collects all values from the
    * member variable meter_, then sends them to the processor_ for
    * processing. After the records have been processed they are sent to the
    * exporter_ to be exported.
    *
    */
    void tick();

private:
    mutex lock_;
    Meter meter_;
    MeterProvider provider_;
    Exporter exporter_;
    int period_;
    int timeout_;
};
```



## **Exporter**

The exporter SHOULD be called with a checkpoint of finished (possibly dimensionally reduced) export records. Most configuration decisions have been made before the exporter is invoked, including which instruments are enabled, which concrete aggregator types to use, and which dimensions to aggregate by.

There is very little left for the exporter to do other than format the metric updates into the desired format and send them on their way.

Design choice: Our idea is to take the simple trace example [OStreamSpanExporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/blob/main/examples/simple/main.cc) and add Metric functionality to it. This will allow us to verify that what we are implementing in the API and SDK works as intended. The exporter will go through the different metric instruments and print the value stored in their aggregators to stdout, **for simplicity only Sum is shown here, but all aggregators will be implemented**.


```cc

## Test Strategy / Plan

Since there is a specification we will be following, we will not have to write out user stories for testing. We will generally only be writing functional unit tests for this project. The C++ Open Telemetry repository uses [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) because it provides test coverage reports, also allows us to easily integrate code coverage tools such as [codecov.io](http://codecov.io/) with the project. A required coverage target of 90% will help to ensure that our code is fully tested.

An open-source header-only testing framework called [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) is an alternate option which would satisfy our testing needs. It is easy to use, supports behavior driven development, and does not need to be embedded in the project as source files to operate (unlike Googletest). Code coverage would still be possible using this testing framework but would require us to integrate additional tools. This framework may be preferred as an agnostic replacement for Googletest and is widely used in open source projects.
