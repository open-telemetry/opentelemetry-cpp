# OTLP Exporter

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/protocol/README.md) (OTLP) is a vendor-agnostic protocol designed as part of the OpenTelemetry project. The OTLP exporter can be used to export to any backend that supports OTLP.

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) is a reference implementation of an OTLP backend. The Collector can be configured to export to many other backends, such as Zipkin and Jaegar.

For a full list of backends supported by the Collector, see the [main Collector repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/master/exporter) and [Collector contributions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter).

## Configuration

The OTLP exporter offers some configuration options. To configure the exporter, create an `OtlpExporterOptions` struct (defined in [exporter.h](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/blob/main/exporters/otlp/include/opentelemetry/exporters/otlp/otlp_exporter.h)), set the options inside, and pass the struct to the `OtlpExporter` constructor, like so:

```
OtlpExporterOptions options;
options.endpoint = "localhost:12345";
auto exporter = std::unique_ptr<sdktrace::SpanExporter>(new otlp::OtlpExporter(options));
```

### Configuration options

| Option       | Default          |
| ------------ |----------------- |
| `endpoint`   | `localhost:4317` |

## Example

For a complete example demonstrating how to use the OTLP exporter, see [examples/otlp](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/blob/main/examples/otlp/).
